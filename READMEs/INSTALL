* Introduction

How to install DDSKK using MELPA, see file INSTALL.MELPA.en.md.

* System-dependent configurations

For system-dependent configurations, see SKK-CFG in the top source
directory.  It describes installation howto as well as
system-dependent setting examples.

If you are a user of Emacs on Apple OS X or Microsoft Windows,
also see one of the following files, which may be found in this
directory.

** README.MacOSX.ja

Describes how to install SKK for Emacs on Apple OS X (10.x).

** README.w32.ja

Describes how to install SKK for Emacs on Microsoft Windows.

* Pre-installation

** Get SKK dictionaries and copy them to ./dic subdirectory.

In DDSKK 17.1, installation of an SKK dictionary is no longer
mandatory under GNU Emacs 24.3 or later.  Emacs 24 contains a japanese
kana-kanji dictionary called ja-dic as a part of the LEIM input
method.  Indeed ja-dic is derived from SKK-JISYO.L and we wrote a
code to use ja-dic for DDSKK.

Although ja-dic may be of some use, it lacks entries for
English-Japanese conversion and numeric conversion, making it inferior
to SKK-JISYO.L.  In this way we recommend installing SKK dictionaries
including SKK-JISYO.L. 

If you do not have SKK dictionaries, get one or more from

    https://skk-dev.github.io/dict/

    Type `make get'.

You should get at least one of "基本辞書" (i.e. basic dictionaries).
If unsure, we recommend SKK-JISYO.L.  All other dictionaries are
optional.

Unpack and copy the downloaded dictionaries to ./dic subdirectory.
They will be installed with `make install'.

If you want to install the SKK L dictionary converted in the CDB
format, follow these steps.

1. Obtain SKK-JISYO.L and copy it to ./dic.
2. Type `make cdb'.  This will call a python script ./etc/skk2cdb.py
   and convert SKK-JISYO.L into SKK-JISYO.L.cdb.  Note that you need
   python installed before this step.
3. After you read the following installation instructions, do `make
   install'.  This will copy both SKK-JISYO.L and SKK-JISYO.L.cdb to
   the same place as SKK.tut, e.g. /usr/share/skk or
   c:/emacs-25.1/etc/skk.
   
4. Set skk-cdb-large-jisyo in your ~/.skk as the following.

   (setq skk-cdb-large-jisyo "/usr/share/skk/SKK-JISYO.L.cdb")

   In this case you may not want Emacs to read SKK-JISYO.L. If so, set
   skk-large-jisyo and skk-aux-large-jisyo in your ~/.skk as the
   following.
   
   (setq skk-large-jisyo nil
   	 skk-aux-large-jisyo nil)

** Edit SKK-CFG.

Edit SKK-CFG for your installation.  Examples are found in SKK-CFG but
commented out.  If you need to set some or all of these variables,
uncomment them and specify the values.  Maybe you need not to edit
Makefile at all.  All customizations can be done in SKK-CFG except for
Emacs command name.  The way how to specify Emacs command name is
described below.

* Installation

** Installation for GNU Emacs

Before actual installation, you can find out installation paths with

    % make what-where

If your editor is not just named emacs, you can specify the name as
the following.

    % make what-where EMACS=/usr/bin/emacs-25.1

If installation paths seem all right, proceed to installation with

    % make install
or
    % make install EMACS=/usr/bin/emacs-25.1

* Post-installation

If you just intend to test the program, no prior setting is required.
Just call SKK with typing C-x C-j or M-x skk-mode.

* Learn SKK

** tutorial

If you are a novice SKK user, you can learn SKK basics with M-x
skk-tutorial.  Follow the instructions.  If you prefer the English
tutorial, type C-u M-x skk-tutorial and select "English".

** manuals (info, web, PDF)

As you learn the usage of SKK, you might want to know more about its
customization.  As a start point we recommend the SKK manual.  You
can find the SKK manual with M-x info and looking for the following
line.

    * SKK: (skk).           Simple Kana to Kanji conversion program.

You can also read the SKK manual on the web.

    https://ddskk.readthedocs.io/ja/latest/

PDF manual are available.

    https://ddskk.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/ja/latest/pdf/

** sample for customization

If you are looking for example elisp codes for customization, see files
etc/dot.emacs and etc/dot.skk, which are included in this distribution.
