* System-dependent configurations

For system-dependent configurations, see SKK-CFG in the top source
directory.  It describes installation howto as well as
system-dependent setting examples.

If you are a user of Emacs on Apple MacOS (X) or Microsoft Windows,
also see one of the following files, which may be found in this
directory.

** README.Mac.ja

Describes how to install SKK for Emacs on Mac OS 8.x or 9.x.

** README.MacOSX.ja

Describes how to install SKK for Emacs on Mac OS X (10.x).

** README.w32.ja

Describes how to install SKK for Emacs on Windows.

* Pre-installation

** APEL

APEL (A Portable Emacs Library) is required to install SKK.  Make sure
you have APEL 10.7 or later installed.  It is highly recommended that
you install the latest release.  APEL is available at:

    http://kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/%7Etomo/lemi/dist/apel/
or
    ftp://ftp.jpl.org/pub/elisp/apel/

** Get SKK dictionaries and copy them to ./dic subdirectory.

If you do not have SKK dictionaries, get one or more from

    http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/skk/wiki/wiki.cgi?page=SKK%BC%AD%BD%F1

You should get at least one of "基本辞書" (i.e. basic dictionaries).
If unsure, we recommend SKK-JISYO.L.  All other dicitionaries are
optional.

Unpack and Copy the downloaded dictionaries to ./dic subdirectory.
They will be installed with `make install' or `make install-package',
which is described below.

** Edit SKK-CFG.

Edit SKK-CFG for your installation.  Examples are found in SKK-CFG but
commented out.  If you need to set some or all of these variables,
uncomment them and specify the values.  Maybe you need not to edit
Makefile at all.  All customizations can be done in SKK-CFG except for
Emacs or XEmacs command name.  The way how to specify Emacs or XEmacs
command name is described below.

* Installation

** Installation for GNU Emacs

Before actual installation, you can find out installation paths with

    % make what-where

If your editor is not just named emacs, you can specify the name as
the following.

    % make what-where EMACS=/usr/bin/emacs-21.4

If installation paths seem all right, proceed to installation with

    % make install
or
    % make install EMACS=/usr/bin/emacs-21.4

** Installation for XEmacs

You can find out installation paths before actual installation with

    % make what-where-package

If your editor is not just named xemacs, you can specify the name as
the following.

    % make what-where-package XEMACS=/usr/bin/xemacs-21.4.20

If installation paths seem all right, proceed to installation with

    % make install-package
or
    % make install-package XEMACS=/usr/bin/xemacs-21.4.20

* Post-installation

** Obsolete check

Many variables and functions have been renamed since the previous
major release.  You are strongly recommended to check old user
settings. This will be done with loading skk-obsolete.el and executing

    M-x skk-obsolete-check-all-files.

** Easy setup

If you just intend to test the program, no prior setting is required.
Just call SKK with typing C-x C-j or M-x skk-mode.

If you are a novice SKK user, you can learn SKK basics with M-x
skk-tutorial.  Follow the instructions.  If you prefer the English
tutorial, type C-u M-x skk-tutorial and select "English".

As you learn the usage of SKK, you might want to know more about its
customization.  As a start point we recommend the SKK manual.  You
can find the SKK manual with M-x info and looking for the following
line.

    * SKK: (skk).           Simple Kana to Kanji conversion program.

You can also read the SKK manual on the web.

    http://openlab.ring.gr.jp/skk/skk-manual/skk-manual-ja.html

Since the web manual is for the latest Daredevil SKK, it might not be
compatible with the version you installed.

If you are looking for example elisp codes for customization, see files
etc/dot.emacs and etc/dot.skk, which are included in this distribution.
